=====3 states with Git=====
(1) Working directory
    --> Area where all of our files and directories and changes are living all the time
(2) Staging area ("Double check area")
    --> Files in directories that we explicitly add to the staging area
(3) Repository
    --> Where all our snapshots are stored
    
Step 1: Git init
        --> Check using ls-a
        --> (master) = Git is initiated
Step 2: Git add
        --> Add files to staging area
